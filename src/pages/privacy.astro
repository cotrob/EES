      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        At Environmental Energy Services ("we," "us," or "our"), we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, suppliers, and other individuals we interact with. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and disclose personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy applies to all personal information we collect as a solar battery installation business operating in Geelong, Victoria, and engaging with customers across Australia.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What Personal Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        "Personal information" is information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. We may collect the following types of personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity and Contact Details:</strong> Your name, address, email address, phone number, and other contact information.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> Details about your solar battery installation, including quotes, invoices, payment details, and service agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Information about your property (e.g., roof type, energy usage) provided during consultations or installations.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive Information:</strong> In some cases, we may collect sensitive information (e.g., financial details for payment plans or government rebate eligibility), but only with your consent and where necessary for our services.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Data:</strong> If you visit our website, we may collect information such as your IP address, browser type, and browsing behavior via cookies (see Section 9).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for our business functions, such as providing solar battery installation services, responding to inquiries, and meeting legal obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Collect Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We collect personal information in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Directly from You:</strong> When you contact us, request a quote, sign a contract, or provide details during the installation process.</li>
        <li><strong>From Third Parties:</strong> We may receive information from energy retailers, solar system suppliers, or government bodies (e.g., for rebates or compliance purposes) where permitted by law or with your consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Via Our Website:</strong> Through forms, inquiries, or automated tools like cookies when you visit our site.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsolicited Information:</strong> If we receive personal information we didn't request and it's not needed for our functions, we will destroy or de-identify it, unless we are required by law to retain it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will inform you at the time of collection (or as soon as practicable) about why we are collecting your information and how it will be used.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Why We Collect and Use Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We collect and use your personal information for the following primary purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide solar battery installation, maintenance, and related services.</li>
        <li>To process payments, issue invoices, and manage contracts.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your installation, including scheduling, updates, and follow-ups.</li>
        <li>To apply for government rebates or incentives on your behalf (where applicable).</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations, such as safety regulations or tax requirements.</li>
        <li>To improve our services, including through feedback or surveys (optional).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also use your information for secondary purposes closely related to these primary purposes (e.g., troubleshooting installation issues), but only if you would reasonably expect us to do so.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We may disclose your personal information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third parties such as electricians, suppliers, or IT providers who assist us in delivering our services.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Retailers or Government Bodies:</strong> Where required for rebates, grid connection approvals, or compliance with regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> For example, financing companies if you opt for a payment plan (with your consent).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Authorities:</strong> If required by law, such as under a court order or for safety reasons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will not disclose your personal information for unrelated purposes unless we have your consent or are permitted by law. If your information is shared with overseas entities (e.g., software providers), we will take reasonable steps to ensure they comply with Australian privacy standards, though their local laws may differ.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Storage and Security of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, or unauthorized access. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Storing data securely in password-protected systems or locked physical files.</li>
        <li>Using encryption for electronic transactions and communications where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Limiting access to personal information to authorized staff only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When we no longer need your personal information, we will securely destroy or de-identify it, unless we are required by law to retain it (e.g., for tax records).
      </p>

      <h2>7. Access and Correction of Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>You have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request access to the personal information we hold about you. We will provide this unless an exception under the Privacy Act 1988 applies (e.g., if it would harm another person's privacy).</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Ask us to correct any inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To make a request, contact us using the details in Section 11. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request. There is no fee for reasonable requests, though we may charge for excessive or complex inquiries.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Anonymity and Pseudonymity</h2>
      <p>
        Where practical, you may interact with us anonymously or using a pseudonym (e.g., for general inquiries). However, we may need your identity for services like installations, contracts, or rebate applications.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Cookies and Website Use</h2>
      <p>
        Our website may use cookies to enhance your experience and collect data such as your browsing preferences. You can disable cookies in your browser, but this may limit some website functionality. Any personal information collected via our website will be handled in accordance with this policy.
      </p>
